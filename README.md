# Gym Bro, iOS app.

### Why Gym Bro?
Many students here at UCI are just starting their gym experience and need to balance this with their busy school schedule. 
For most students getting a personal trainer isn’t possible resulting in students going to the gym without knowing what they 
need to do. A personalized workout routine through an easily accessible app would help solve these issues. New gym goers and 
even experienced gym goers could see their goals reached through custom plans focused around their busy lives. 

### Goals
We wanted to create an app that recommends available exercises based on a user’s preference. We have built a system that recommends what workouts a user 
should do on a particular day along with the weight, number of reps, and number of sets. This is based on the 
user's workout history and timeline information. We use 4 data sources to build a personal model 
and 1 for the contextual information: 

Personal Model Data Sources:
- Initial User Survey filled out on mobile app (user profile/height, weight, age …)
- Previous scores of all relevant past workouts (logged from the user through a rating system)
- Workout data collected implicitly from the user (weight, reps, sets, duration)
- Workout frequency and time since the last workout

Context Data Sources:
- Fitness data collected from an external fitness site (https://strengthlevel.com/)
